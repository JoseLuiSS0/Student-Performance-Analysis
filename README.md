# Student Mathematics Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes student performance in Mathematics using real educational data.
The objective is to understand which factors influence the final grade and to build a simple predictive model.

## Dataset

* **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
* **File:** `student-mat.csv`
* **Description:** Data from Portuguese secondary school students, including academic, social, and family-related variables.

**Target variable:**

* `G3` (final Mathematics grade)

---

## Tools

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

---

## Analysis

The project includes:

* Data cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization of key relationships
* Linear regression model to predict final grades

---

## Results

* Previous grades (`G1`, `G2`) strongly correlate with final performance.
* Absences negatively impact final grades.
* Study time and academic support show moderate influence.
